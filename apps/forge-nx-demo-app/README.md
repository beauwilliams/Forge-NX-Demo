# forge-nx-demo-app

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using this app with Forge make sure to initially build the app using

    nx build forge-nx-demo-app

After that, proceed with the initial registration of the app with the Forge platform by running the following commands from the dist directory:  

    forge register
    forge deploy
    forge install


This will initially register the app with the Forge platform, deploy the code and finally install the app on any of your Atlassian applications.

## Tunnel-based dev loop

Before you tunnel a Forge app, make sure you have completed the prerequisites steps above. After that, run

    nx serve forge-nx-demo-app

This will start the `serve` target for all Custom UI projects defined in the app `manifest.yml` on their specified tunnel port. After that, it will start a build process in watch mode for the Forge app itself, before ultimately, starting the `forge tunnel` process for the Forge app.

## Manual dev loop

When the app code changes, the updated code has to rebuilt by calling 

    nx build forge-nx-demo-app

and re-deployed to the Forge platform using

    nx deploy forge-nx-demo-app

If the app's `manifest.yml` changed, you may have to upgrade an existing installation by running

    forge install --upgrade

from within the dist directory.
